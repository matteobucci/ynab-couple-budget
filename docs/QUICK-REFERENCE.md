- [ ] Budget amount in personal "Shared Expenses" category
- [ ] Record income in shared budget (your contribution account)
- [ ] Flag transaction purple, memo with month name

## Transaction Routing

| Scenario | Personal Budget | Shared Budget |
|----------|-----------------|---------------|
| Shared expense (you pay) | Shared Expenses | Your Account → Category |
| Shared expense (partner pays) | — | Partner Account → Category |
| Partner pays you back | Balancing (+) | Optional adjustment |
| You pay partner back | Balancing (-) | Optional adjustment |
| Personal expense | Personal category | — |

## Key Categories

### In Personal Budget
```
Shared Expenses        → Your monthly contribution pool
Shared Expense Balancing → Direct transfers between partners
```

### In Shared Budget
```
Inflow: Ready to Assign → Where contributions land
[Your] Contributions    → Account tracking your activity
```

## Contribution Formula

```
Total Household Budget = Person A Contribution + Person B Contribution

Person A Rate = A Contribution / Total × 100%
Person B Rate = B Contribution / Total × 100%
```

Example:
- A: €2,200 → 55%
- B: €1,800 → 45%
- Total: €4,000/month for shared expenses

## Monthly Review Questions

1. Did we stay within budget per category?
2. Are contribution amounts still fair?
3. Any large expenses coming up?
4. Need to adjust next month's contributions?
